# AwesomeCommands

A plugin with various useful commands  
All commands can be disabled via the config


# Description
### NPRestart
This will restart the server as soon as there are no players online.  
For this to work, you must have your spigot restart settings set up properly!  
`/NPRestart` or `/NPR`  
If you change your mind, simply type the command again to cancel it.

### Search
`/search mcmmo mining`  
This will give the user search link(s) to click(Unlimited links, configurable in the config) instead of switching to a browser to search(Pure for laziness)

### Sit & UnSit
This will make all the players wolves and ocelots sit or stand on demand.
